# Running log

## 2026-10-18

**Done**
- AWS environment check on the course WorkSpace (Amazon WorkSpaces, m8i-flex.large, Windows Server
  2022, 2 vCPU, 7.7 GB RAM).
  - PASS: GitHub push (dry run), Python 3.12 with the pinned packages, `lattice_gnn` import and the
    data check on the samples, Claude Code sign-in (Caltech enterprise seat), network and
    literature tools.
  - FAIL: GPU, Docker, Abaqus (not installed; license server reachable).
  - NOT TESTED: persistence after restart, S3, cost alerts.
- Installed Python 3.12.10 from the NuGet package, because MSI installers are blocked on the
  WorkSpace.
- Added a command-line route for the literature agent's tools (`agents/literature/cli.py`), now the
  default for `python -m agents.literature`. Bash is restricted to that one command; tested that
  everything else is refused.
- Literature agent runs (`claude-sonnet-5-5`):
  - Attempt 1 (`literature_review/main_attempt1/`) stopped after 32 turns when a tool call with a
    formula was refused by Claude Code's shell-safety check.
  - Attempt 2 (`literature_review/main/`): 81 turns, 22 papers, `lit_review.md`. Page citations for
    Indurkar 2022 and Grega 2024 checked against the PDFs: 10 of 11 hold up; 1 is a paraphrase.
- Lab Report 1 written (`reports/lab_report_1.md`).

**Remaining**
- Read the dataset paper's supplementary information (how C and n were fitted, exclusions);
  reconcile 17,262 / 17,221 / 17,201 / 17,087.
- Baselines and a first CPU GNN training run.
- Literature run on defects; FE solver choice.

**Bottlenecks**
- Abaqus not installed, and AWS licence use not yet confirmed. Workaround: CalculiX or OpenSeesPy.
  Plan: confirm with Caltech IT by 1 Nov.
- Not treated as bottlenecks:
  - No GPU: training runs on the CPU.
  - No Docker: the WorkSpace itself is the isolated environment for code-running agents.
  - MSI installs blocked: worked around with NuGet Python. The venv should still be rebuilt on it.
  - No S3 or billing access.
